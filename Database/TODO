	Some tasks depend on other tasks being done first.
	This is denoted by the
		x.y notation.
	Lower valued y's must be done before higher valued y's
	of the same x.
	
	Tasks with different x values may be done at any time
	independent of eachother.

	A task which has been complted should be moved to the
	bottom and the x.y value should be replaced by DONE.

	If you are working on a task, make sure to put your name
	next to the x.y value as in:
		Name x.y
	That way, others will know to work on something else
	or to consult you before working on the task that
	you have already been working on.

(2) Currently the exportDatabase.php script must be ran from
    the command line. This is not very useful for programmers
    who simply want to import and invoke a function from their 
    own script. Most of exportDatabase.php (the part that does
    not parse the command line) can be abstracted to a function
    accepting the interpreted command line arguments. The new
    file can be called exportDatabaseFunctions.php. Then, the
    exportDatabase.php script will simply call this function
    with the parsed command line.

	Seperate the importDatabase() function into two functions:
		importOldDatabase() -- which is identical to the
		current importDatabase() function
		
		importDatabase() -- adds the data in a .csv file
		to the database
			--assume that the file has the format
		"TableName"
		"Column1", "Column2",...
		"Data1","Data2",...
		"Data1","Data2",...
		
		"TableName2"
		...

		***The newline between tables is optional and should not
		be used as a flag when parsing the file.
		Just check if the line from the file (after being trimmed
		of whitespace) is in fact the name of a table in the 
		database. If it is an existing table, then assume the
		next line contains the columns of the table and
		the following lines are the data of the table until another
		row is encountered which is a valid table name.***

		Do not assume that all the columns will be present. Just add
		the data to the columns that are present in the spreasheet.

(6)	Need to add a "Post-Graduate Degree" column.
	Or maybe it should be called "ExtendedDegree" because 
	that is what Amy kept saying.

---------------STUFF THAT'S DONE---------------------------
(DONE) Have convert.py output a file named TableNames
    which contains the name of a table with a corresponding
    .csv file for each file generated by the convert.py
    script. 

    The importDatabase.php script should then read in the
    names of the tables into the $tableNames array by
    parsing the TableNames file.
    
    This way, should convert.py change to create
    more (or less) or differently named tables, the 
    importDatabase.php script will not have to be edited
    in any way.
